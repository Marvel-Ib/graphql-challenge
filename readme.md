## notes

### What technology am i using?
* [TypeGraphQL](https://typegraphql.com/)
* [TypeGoose](https://typegoose.github.io/typegoose/)

### All bank codes are supported. examples of banks and there bank code:  
* Kuda Bank -- 50211
* First Bank of Nigeria -- 011
* Access Bank -- 044
* GtBank -- 058
* Zenith Bank -- 057
* United Bank for Africa -- 033

### Could not use flutterwave and paystack
* there verify account endpoints did not seems to work without being full verified. both threw errors consistently
* had to look for another api and utilize it: https://maylancer.org/api/nuban/
* this api returns account full name in this order : [surname] [first name] [middle name]

###  Levenshtein Distance algorithm more effective than Damerauâ€“Levenshtein Distance algorithm in account name scenario 
* We are trying to ensure that if there was a small error during data entry we are still able to still resolve names 
* levenshetein distance operations (insertions, deletions or substitutions, of single characters) is more than enough to detect this small errors 
* using damerau-levenshtein algorithm will be an overkill ( if there is a case we have to use it to get a number less than 3 then that definitely means there is a big error in the names
